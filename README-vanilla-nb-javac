This is an early prototype of a way to compile JDK 16+ javac to run on JDK 8+, for the pruposes of NetBeans ("vanilla-nb-javac").

Steps to compile vanilla-nb-javac:
1. from JDK 16, ideally commit ae1eb286c6a2e76c3b38d68641208d4c01d4eef8, copy "src/java.compiler" and "src/jdk.compiler" into "src/java.compiler" and "src/jdk.compiler" in this project
2. from a JDK 16 build, copy:
com/sun/tools/javac/resources/CompilerProperties.java
into:
jdk.compiler/share/classes/com/sun/tools/javac/resources/CompilerProperties.java
and:
com/sun/tools/javac/resources/LauncherProperties.java
into:
jdk.compiler/share/classes/com/sun/tools/javac/resources/LauncherProperties.java
3. apply temporary-patches/language-changes patch. This includes backport language changes, which should eventually also be done using NetBeans/Jackpot
4. open the make/langtools/netbeans/nb-javac project in NetBeans. Neccessary setup (in Project Properties):
-in Libraries tab, set Java Platform to JDK 11+ (tested with JDK 16) (JDK 8 javac contains a bug that will prevent compilation of the sources)
-in Build/Compiling tab, make sure there is an "Additiona Compiler Options" entry specifying -bootclasspath from JDK 8 (i.e. rt.jar)
5. open src/META-INF/upgrades/nbjavac.hint, invoke Run File, select the project Custom Scope. Do the refactoring. (There should be 102 replacements done.)
6. apply temporary-patches/manual-workarounds to workaround a few mistakes in the transformation
7. the project should now be buildable. Not tried in NetBeans yet.
8. If you would want to test on the commandline, apply filesystems-run-on-jdk8 and clean & build. Then it should be possible to run like:
java -Xbootclasspath/p:make/langtools/netbeans/nb-javac/dist/nb-javac-15-api.jar:make/langtools/netbeans/nb-javac/dist/nb-javac-15-impl.jar com.sun.tools.javac.Main --system <path-to-JDK16> TextBlock.java

Note step 8 is optional and only needed for experiments on command line, while running on JDK 8 and compiling for JDK 9+. Not needed in NetBeans.


TODO (incomplete):
-automatic build (including CompilerProperties, etc.)
-cleanup
-fix nbjavac wrappers
-fix Jackpot
-resolve language changes
-jdeps needed? (classfile library?)
-test - all javac, nb-javac and NetBeans (including updates)
